# TF_IDF_Matching
Implement a CLI tool for:
1) Tf-Idf based document retrieval: For each query, your system will output top k documents
based on tf-idf-matching-score.
2) Tf-Idf based vector space document retrieval: For each query, your system will output top
k documents based on a cosine similarity between query and document vector.
